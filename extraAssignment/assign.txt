Q.1 Illustrate the need for request Package

The request package was developed to simplify the process of making HTTP requests in Node.js applications.
It helps developers to easily perform actions such as:

Sending and receiving data over the web.

Communicating with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

Handling various request methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Managing request headers, form data, and file uploads effortlessly.

Need for request package:

Ease of use: Simple syntax for making network calls.

Reduces code complexity: Handles lower-level networking details internally.

API Integration: Essential for connecting servers to third-party services.

Efficient error handling: Provides structured responses and errors.

Therefore, the request package made it quick and efficient to perform client-server communications in Node.js based web development.

Q.2 Implement a small application which will make use of the mentioned package

Application:
A simple Node.js application that fetches data from a public API. by program in  app.js file

Q.3 Illustrate the need for Code of Ethics

In the field of software development, a Code of Ethics is critical to ensure responsible and professional behavior.
It defines the values, rules, and standards that developers should follow while building and managing software applications.

Need for Code of Ethics:

User Trust: Protects the rights and interests of users.

Data Privacy and Security: Ensures sensitive user data is handled safely and responsibly.

Professional Accountability: Developers are answerable for their work and its impact.

Fairness and Non-Discrimination: Promotes equality and prevents bias in software systems.

Quality Assurance: Encourages building reliable, error-free, and safe software products.

Legal Compliance: Helps avoid legal issues by adhering to laws and regulations (like GDPR, Copyright laws).

In short, Code of Ethics guides developers to build trustworthy, fair, and responsible software, maintaining public trust in the technology they create.
